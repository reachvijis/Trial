This project is to schedule a date and time for the Meet The Masters (MTM)Volunteer Arts program for my son's school. Every month a volunteer will schedule a date and time with their teacher and teach about the art for that month. Currently, all the scheduling is done by individual volunteers following up with the teacher. This creates contradiction if two classes have the MTM at the same time. So, I want to develop a centralized system that will check the timing of other class and schedule a date and email the teachers and volunteer.
This project is developed in ASP.net, C#, VB Script,Visual Studio 2012,SQL Server 2012.
